# Python Learning üêç

Welcome to **Python Learning**, a repository where I document my journey of learning Python! üöÄ

## About

This repository is a collection of my practice code, notes, exercises, projects, and experiments as I explore the Python programming language. The goal is to track my progress, reinforce my understanding, and share my learning experience with others.

## Contents

- **Basic Concepts**: Variables, data types, conditionals, loops, etc.
- **Functions and Modules**: Understanding functions, modules, and code organization.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, and more.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Exception handling and debugging techniques.
- **Projects**: Small Python projects and scripts that I build as I learn.
- **Advanced Topics**: Generators, decorators, context managers, etc. (as I progress further)

## Why This Repo?

- **Learning by Doing**: Applying the concepts I learn in real-time by writing code.
- **Track My Progress**: Document my learning journey and track my growth over time.
- **Share with the Community**: Share my learning experience with others who are also learning Python.
- **Receive Feedback**: Open to feedback and suggestions to improve my code and understanding.

## How to Use This Repo

Feel free to explore the code, review the notes, or use the examples to practice and improve your Python skills. If you have any suggestions or spot any errors, contributions and feedback are welcome!
